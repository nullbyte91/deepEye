We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features
Becoming a maintainer
We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.
Issue that pull request!
Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
This is an example of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's another example from Craig Hockenberry, an app developer whom I greatly respect.

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

A quick summary and/or background
Steps to reproduce
Be specific!
Give sample code if you can. My stackoverflow question includes sample code that anyone with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
What you expected would happen
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

Use a Consistent Coding Style
I'm again borrowing these from Facebook's Guidelines

2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
You can try running npm run lint for style unification
